In this project we preprocessed the  bank loan data into a readable form by using numpy mathematical computational library
which is  a very powerful tool 
in this we do perform task:
1.Data cleaning
2.Removing duplicate values
3.filling the missing values
4.arranging the data into a right format
5.seperate the numeric and string data features processed seperately and then merge
